Check the following options in the kernel configuration:
File systems  --->
  [*] FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support


Using Ntfs-3g

To mount a Windows partition at boot time, put a line like this in /etc/fstab:

/dev/sda1 /mnt/windows auto defaults 0 0

To allow users to mount a usb stick with an NTFS filesystem on it, put a line similar to this (change sdc1 to whatever a usb stick would be on your system) in /etc/fstab:

/dev/sdc1 /mnt/usb auto user,noauto,umask=0,utf8 0 0

In order for a user to be able to mount the usb stick, they will need to be able to write to /mnt/usb, so as the root user:

chmod -v 777 /mnt/usb
